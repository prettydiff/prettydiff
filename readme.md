## About Me
I am a software developer at Bank of America working on UI for login and authentication controls.

If you need a JavaScript/TypeScript developer that enjoys solving new and challenging problems email me at **info at prettydiff.com** but please understand that I have no experience or interest in writing ReactJS.
React is great for junior developers to quickly publish dynamic content to the screen.
I am not a junior developer, though, that is not a challenging software problem that interests me.

## Focus
I am currently working on https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems

In this personal project I am trying to solve the problem of decentralization with a focus on privacy, permissions, performance, and automation.
Decentralization is likely not what you think it is.
For an excellent and mature example of decentralization see the architecture of [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).
My current project approaches the application considerations of decentralization far more aggressively than the media considerations defined by WebRTC.

## How I Code
My prefered code style is imperative functional, such that code should be portable and not littered with unnecessary decoration or extranous execution steps.
This follows a mental model of explicit brevity and expresses a *say what you mean, not what you meant to say* line of thinking.
If you are a prospective employer and want to see how I code please see my [homework assignment](https://github.com/prettydiff/homework).
