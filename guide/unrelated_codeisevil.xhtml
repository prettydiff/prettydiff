                        <h3>Code is Inherently
                            <strong>Evil</strong>.</h3>
                        <p>More precisely writing code is a form of debt, which is evil. The desirable
                            outcome is not the code itself, but rather the solution to a problem offered by the
                            code. The degree of evilness is a direct measure of the amount of time it sucks
                            from a soul over the lifespan of the application. The ultimate goal is to
                            produce a superior product in the least amount of time with the lowest cost of
                            maintenance. Observe the following criteria:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="segment">
                        <h3>Hierarchy of Goals to Repel Evil.</h3>
                        <p>Achieve these rules in the order provided to resist the forces of evil.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Write stable and defensive code.</h4>
                                <p>Broken buggy code means time spent infuriating your users and fixing defects
                                    instead of writing enhancements. Defects increase the evilness of your
                                    application, and most defects are not known to you. If you get this correct and
                                    fail at everything else, you are still at least half successful.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Write fast code.</h4>
                                <p>Faster executing code is less evil code. If your application is slow your
                                    users won't have the patience to notice anything else.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Write simple code.</h4>
                                <p>Ambitious goals do not mean ambitious code. Always keep your code simple and
                                    well organized so long as it does not violate the previous rules. Searching the
                                    code base for defects is evil. Deciphering algorithms is evil. Guessing what
                                    extends what is evil. Expect other people to read the code and enhancement it
                                    without your input.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Write code quickly.</h4>
                                <p>Solving bugs in mere minutes impresses people. Easy to maintain code saves
                                    you time and it means a faster return on suggestions to your users, which saves
                                    them time. Saving your users time is the most powerful weapon in the fight
                                    against evil code. Always write the simplest code possible provided it does not
                                    violate the previous rules.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Write less code.</h4>
                                <p>Anything that can be accomplished in fewer instructions is less evil. Bloat
                                    directly increases the evilness of your code. Ultimately, this is the most
                                    important rule, but only when it does not impose harm. Cutting corners
                                    frequently results in increased evil, so this rule must not be exercised at
                                    expense to the prior rules.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Empower Your Users.</h3>
                        <p>If your application saves your users more time compared to its competitors or
                            provides a more enjoyable experience, then it is superior. Game over, you win.
                            To accomplish this the application must achieve these criteria:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Solve a valid problem.</h4>
                                <p>Solutions in need of a problem are evil. Simple solutions to complex problems
                                    are the programmer's most powerful weapon.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Sturdiness and stability.</h4>
                                <p>Does your application break or fail in its tasks? Broken applications are
                                    evil. Most defects will not be known to you.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Accomplishment of goals.</h4>
                                <p>Challenging goals make for a superior product, but broken promises are evil
                                    and embarrassing. Be clear in what you want to achieve and conquer those
                                    objectives with iron-fisted certainty. Manage your expectations appropriately.
                                    If you are honest and fair to yourself a tiny spark of determination is
                                    sufficient to accomplish all.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Speed.</h4>
                                <p>Speed in all things. Faster execution speed is what your users will notice
                                    first, and so this is supremely important. Provide faster interactions and
                                    faster access to the desired results and content. Be active in the maintenance
                                    of your software and respond to user communications quickly. Users always take
                                    notice of prompt communication and delight in prompt resolution.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Understandability.</h4>
                                <p>If your application is not immediately clear, then provide strong
                                    documentation and define your purpose clearly. Users will actually read it to
                                    learn more, especially if your application is superior to the competition.
                                    Encourage feedback and use this to fill gaps in understandability and then
                                    improve the documentation when you don't have to. Confusing applications are
                                    evil. Confusing documentation is more evil. Communicate clearly, directly, and
                                    with a purpose while using as few words as possible. Visual examples are
                                    wonderful. Flashy graphics and animations are like a bad blind date in that they
                                    attract stupid lonely people, but lose all value after a drunken first
                                    impression.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Reproducibility.</h4>
                                <p>The more places your application can run the more popular and dependable it
                                    will become. Does your application run in exactly the same way everywhere? If
                                    not your application is evil.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Ownership.</h4>
                                <p>Good software with a healthy following is largely due to ownership. Always
                                    own your code. For every success and failure take ownership. For every success
                                    be humble and thankful. Address all who helped you on your path to success. If
                                    you believe that you have achieved success entirely on your own then you are an
                                    evil toxic liar, and many people will believe you.</p>
                                <p>Own every failure and accept all blame. People want to hear your solutions
                                    and assurances of fidelity. Nobody wants to hear your excuses. Uttering excuses
                                    is advertising incompetence. Own your code, always.</p>

                                <h4>Never Write for the Lowest Common Denominator</h4>
                                <p>This can best be described as:
                                    <em>garbage in, garbage out</em>. Don't plan your application and enforce code
                                    styles for the weakest developer. Instead put forth the best possible approach
                                    for an organization's business objectives and don't dumb it down. This will
                                    require the weak contributors to step up or get out without slowing everybody
                                    else down. When this scares people suggest pair programming.</p>
                                <p>Providing allowances for less qualified developers means making sacrifices.
                                    Most commonly this means adding a bunch of, in some cases 10-15 times more,
                                    code. It is a run-away snowball (freefall) of increased debt, because more code
                                    means more unit tests and liabilities. Remember that nothing is more evil than
                                    additional code.</p>
                                <p>In many other cases it can mean hiding non-existent problems behind
                                    unnecessary abstractions to synthetically appear that there is less code when
                                    actually there is much more. Due to the nature of lower level optimizations,
                                    like instruction caching, in some rare cases abstractions can increase execution
                                    performance. Mostly, though, abstractions make code execution noticeably slower.
                                    As an example, this is almost universally the case when working with the DOM.
                                    That means your abstraction is the point of increased evil and not the DOM.</p>

                                <h4>Use Explicit Application Structures</h4>
                                <p>Explicit application structures mean that the code is written in such a way
                                    that the structure of the code's organization in written form almost directly
                                    reflects its execution order and structure in memory. The goal is to close the
                                    gap between the organization how the code is written versus how it is organized
                                    in execution. The primary qualities to consider are scope, reference
                                    availability, and modularity.</p>
                                <p>Thinking about code in terms of explicit structures forces developers to
                                    think in terms of big problems first and gradually work to the minor trivial
                                    items, a top down approach. This is healthy. The big picture items don't have to
                                    be specific or precise early on, because they can be tightened up later. This
                                    results in code that is well planned, easy to follow, and focused in what it
                                    wants to do. The tiny precise qualities are addressed and solved through
                                    requirements and unit tests, which require less creativity, so this stuff is
                                    lower priority. The result is less code and easier application optimization
                                    later.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes explicit structures can mean deep nesting. This scares the crap out
                                    of insecure developers, who may confuse this idea for nested data structures. I
                                    don't care. Explicit structures make for faster code debugging and near
                                    immediate understanding of relationships in the various code pieces. If as a
                                    developer this scares you then I suggest finding a mentor. If as a developer
                                    this offends you then you are in the wrong line of work.</p>

                                <p>If your application fails because it pulls in a broken dependency you are a
                                    failure. You can cry, whine, and complain about how it isn't your fault but your
                                    application is still broken. If this application generates revenue, then you are
                                    now bleeding money. Actually, it is your fault, because you failed to manage
                                    your dependencies. Game over.</p>

                                <h4>Use Build Systems Wisely</h4>
                                <p>An application build system takes time to run. Think of this a thief robbing
                                    you and your business of time or a vampire bleeding you of life force.
                                    Essentially it is stealing from you. There should never be a build process
                                    separating your code from its execution. I understand most languages require a
                                    static compile step, so therefore they are more evil except if their resulting
                                    software offers noticeably superior execution performance. The advantage of not
                                    having a build system is that you can modify the code and then execute it
                                    immediately without any intermediate steps (wasted time).</p>
                                <p>When there is no build step between your code and its execution the developer
                                    can more closely share in the experience a user performs to execute the
                                    application. End users are not going to jump through hoops to build your
                                    application with a bunch of configuration steps just to run it for the first
                                    time, so why would you?</p>
                                <p>It is helpful to have an automation task to run unit tests, perform code
                                    validation, update code and data from a remote source, and so forth. In this
                                    case a build system is advantageous when it prevents code regression and
                                    automates various required tasks. This saves time or lowers risk. Instead of
                                    stealing from you this is more like interest on a financial fund, in that it
                                    returns payments of time merely for the pleasure of your initial investment. The
                                    faster this sort of automation job executes and the more problems it prevents
                                    from entering production the more valuable it becomes.</p>

                                <h4>Be Imperative</h4>
                                <p>When writing code seek to accomplish your objective as directly as possible,
                                    bottom line up front (BLUF). Don't tip toe around the problem with finesse and
                                    elegant descriptions. Well written code is either immediately clear in what it
                                    is doing or it is directly inferred from the context and structure of the code's
                                    location in the application. When clarity is absent from merely reading the code
                                    bad things happen. All the declarative and conventional wisdom are just
                                    smokescreens suppressing the symptoms of gross negligence and incompetence that
                                    we are all occasionally guilty of. When code is lacking of transparency and
                                    clarity then as a developer you are failing: yourself, your teams, and
                                    ultimately your users. Go back and rewrite it to be more direct.</p>
                                <p>One thing declarative coding styles kind of get right is use of naming
                                    conventions for references and preference for descriptive and unique reference
                                    names. Don't over think this though. Application code is not a novel. Novels are
                                    meant to be read by people, but application code is meant to be executed by
                                    machines. Reference names have to be unique enough only to avoid confusing a
                                    variable in one location for a different variable elsewhere. The only time
                                    reference names must be absolutely unique is in the case of identification by
                                    automated profiling tools. I have a convention I use to enforce uniqueness on
                                    function names that I will never read, because they are for profilers and not
                                    for me.</p>
                                <p>Reference names should be descriptive enough to kind of hint at what they
                                    store. This has to be just descriptive enough that the reference name jogs your
                                    memory upon reading it so that you don't have to look up its definition multiple
                                    times. I have seen people really over think this and waste a bunch of energy on
                                    incredibly long reference names. They should save this for their doctoral
                                    dissertation that will be read by only 7 people.</p>
                                <p>You should never need code to explain what it is doing or how it is doing it.
                                    You can determine this yourself without the extraneous descriptions by reading
                                    the code. Where extra descriptions and documentation come in handy is to explain
                                    the
                                    <em>why</em>, as in the decisions that resulted in the logic you are reading
                                    now. Be helpful and quickly document such decisions in code comments in as few
                                    words as possible. Don't document anything else except risks and known problems.</p>

                                <h4>Never Use Inheritance</h4>
                                <p>The first reason is that it requires additional code. The extra code exists
                                    to satisfy conventions required by the code and not to ease human comprehension.
                                    This means more meaningless code to write, read, and maintain. Ask yourself if
                                    you would rather read a 2000 page book or a 200 page book containing exactly the
                                    same plot and descriptive elaboration.</p>
                                <p>Inheritance is an unstructured architectural concept. Structures emerge from
                                    inheritance through extension of atomic units, which forms an implied or ad hoc
                                    application architecture. This is bad. The direct harm is a lot more energy and
                                    effort must be taken to form and enforce a well-planned architecture in a given
                                    application. The indirect harm is that inheritance tends to result in
                                    applications that are composed of many relatively flat atomic units where the
                                    structure is only evident at execution time. This is really bad, because it
                                    means most effort debugging a problem will be spent searching for locations to
                                    troubleshoot in the code instead of thinking about solutions.</p>
                                <p>If at maintenance time more than 50% of the effort is spent looking for
                                    something your application architecture is a failure. If when reading the code,
                                    the organization and structure of the application are not immediately clear your
                                    application architecture is a failure. If you require a super advanced IDE to
                                    find things in the code your application architecture is a failure. Inheritance
                                    strongly enables these negative qualities while introducing additional lines of
                                    code to slow you down further.</p>
                                <p>Most of the resistance to moving away from inheritance has to do with a
                                    combination of stubbornness, arrogance, and tradition. The first means of
                                    combating this ignorance is to admit alternatives exist. If you are unwilling to
                                    even do this, then you are evil. Second, determine the benefits inheritance
                                    directly provides to your current application and directly challenge those
                                    opinions with alternative approaches to see what the result would look like for
                                    your application.</p>

                            These violations are frequently due to childish immaturity or selfishness. When
                            evident in a leader the common military phrase is

                                <h4>Incompetence</h4>
                                <p>When interviewing in the past this is the first thing I would look for. Is
                                    the given candidate even remotely qualified? If you focus all your energy on
                                    <em>how</em>
                                    code should be written you are a beginner. I don't care if you have 15
                                    years of experience with the best names in the industry. You are operating at a
                                    lower level of career maturity and I will treat you like a beginner. If you are
                                    strong in the ways of identifying and reducing evil, you will already know how to
                                    write code well and unintentionally so. Instead of thinking in terms of
                                    <em>how</em>
                                    think in terms of
                                    <em>why</em>
                                    and make stronger more defensible decisions.</p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, incompetence is common. In fact, it is generally the tolerated
                                    standard, which is why talent gaps are so prolific in software. This is not
                                    because technology is too hard to learn or because people are generally too
                                    stupid. Mentoring and training are absent from the work place, which leaves a
                                    developer to figure things out on their own. Those rare super talented
                                    developers that rise above the rest are people who spend time, measured in
                                    years, outside the office solving problems and self-training when they don't
                                    have to. Any common developer will see, with clarity, the problems that prevent
                                    immediate task completion. You won't see the second and third order consequences
                                    of your half-baked resolution without some deeper experiences. If you want to
                                    work with a stronger team then introduce mentorship programs, formal training,
                                    and pair programming.</p>

                                <p>I am putting a section on women in here just to see if you are paying
                                    attention. Women are severely underrepresented in software development and that
                                    is a complete failure. Women tend to evaluate balance of requirements, focus on complex
                                    problems, and prioritize responsibilities slightly differently than men. That means
                                    diversity in common assumptions in how basic problems are approached. I am
                                    fortunate, at the time of this writing, to work in an office that is largely gender
                                    balanced with most of the women developers substantially more experienced than myself.</p>

                                <p>People who complain frequently without effort towards some resolution. This
                                    behavior depresses everyone like childhood leukemia. Complaints are only ok when
                                    followed by some action towards resolution or when used as a tool for positive
                                    interpersonal bonding on a team.</p>

                                <p>People who make decisions entirely vested upon perceived popularity lack the
                                    research and critical decision making skills to be technologists. Politely
                                    introduce these poor confused souls to your marketing team and walk away hoping
                                    to never see them again. Trends come and go, but bad decisions remain for a very
                                    long time at great expense.</p>

                                <p>Stubborn is completely different from defiant, but to non-critical people
                                    they appear to be the same trend opposing quality. Both stubborn and defiant
                                    people can slow a process or rapid decision forming. Stubborn people are evil
                                    fools who live and die by a behavior called
                                    <em>cognitive conservatism</em>. In a world of really bad technology decisions
                                    defiant people are those blessed angles who challenge everything. The defining
                                    character difference is that defiant people will surrender when presented
                                    evidence or a superior evil reducing argument.</p>

                                <h4>Trend Whores</h4>
                                <p>Trend whoring occurs when an individual uses perceived popularity as the only
                                    grading metric. Popularity might be a quality worthy of strong consideration,
                                    but when you ignore everything else you are evil. This behavior is present when
                                    a person completely lacks common decision making considerations or
                                    prioritization and evaluation. Responding to popularity is an artificial
                                    decision making process because the decisions are already made by numbers
                                    presented to you.</p>
                            </li>

                                <h4>Analysis Paralysis</h4>
                                <p>When claiming not enough data is present to make a decision you are suffering
                                    from analysis paralysis. There could always be more data. Any decision, even a
                                    knowingly wrong decision, is better than no decision at all. If you fail to
                                    make a decision somebody else will make it for you and impose all its
                                    liabilities upon you. Congratulations, you just graduated to scape goat. Stop
                                    being a coward, just make a damn decision, and own it like a titan. You can
                                    always make a different decision at a later time in the face of new evidence.</p>

                                <h4>Cowards</h4>
                                <p>Everybody will at some point experience fear. Cowards are people who
                                    deliberately hide from their fears without regard for harm or risk to anybody
                                    else. I struggle to find something more evil. This is worse than panic.</p>
                                <p>In the corporate world there are two common things that people fear: failure
                                    and confrontation. Get over yourself. Everybody fails. Learn from it and become
                                    more competent. Gracefully recovering from failure or supporting others in the
                                    face of failure are strongly admired qualities that are profoundly noticed.</p>
                                <p>Positive confrontations are good things. This is how business is conducted.
                                    So long as you are direct, factual, honest, and empathetic you should have
                                    nothing to fear. If you are still afraid you should not be allowed to have a
                                    job.</p>

                        <p>These are deliberate decisions taken in defiance of the preferred way of

                                <p>I still use for loops to iterate over arrays on large complex operations
                                    instead of the more modern and elegant
                                    <em>Array.prototype.foreach</em>
                                    method. For loops can be broken at any time, but foreach cannot. You can
                                    manipulate the index of for loops thereby jumping forward, or even backwards, to
                                    fit the needs of your logic. This cannot be done in a foreach. As a result, for
                                    loops can be considerably faster than the foreach method depending upon the
                                    needs of the application.</p>

                                <p>NPM is now the largest and most popular module distribution network. I have

                                <p>JSLint is far stricter than JSHint, and sturdiness is important. ESLint is
