                        <p>This document will only focus upon DOM Level 2. Although DOM Level 1 is still
                            universally supported this document views it as an expired and purely legacy
                            artifact. XML namespaces and event execution, as well its memory management,
                            will not be discussed thereby negating need to dwell upon DOM Level 3 and 4.</p>
                        <p>This document is an attempt to explain what the DOM is, how to use it, and
                            why it is defined the way it is. The intended audience is anybody wanting to
                            enrich their understanding of the DOM. Although the DOM is language agnostic
                            this document is writing from the perspective of JavaScript.</p>

                            helpers. This document seeks to be educational, which is to say this document

                        <h4>What the DOM Is</h4>
                        <p>The DOM serves primarily as an API for JavaScript to access and interpret any
                            markup language based upon the XML syntax, which still includes HTML. It is
                            language agnostic so that it can be used and defined by a variety of languages
                            in a variety of ways. As expressed in JavaScript, the DOM is a collection of
                            objects that inherit from a master object named:
                            <em>document</em>. Each data facet conveyed by the DOM is an object. The
                            inheritance and relationships naturally demonstrated through the document
                            structure of the markup (functional inheritance) is defined in the DOM through
                            methods inherited from the document object.</p>
                        <p>It is important to recognize the DOM is the standard way that web browsers
                            interact with HTML. Every JavaScript framework, library, and abstraction that
                            accesses the DOM ultimately does so through the standard DOM methods. A proper
                            understanding of the DOM is critical for accessibility, performance, semantics,
                            and basic problem solving.</p>
                        <p>Every data facet expressed by the DOM is referred to as a
                            <em>node</em>. Every node is defined of one of
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html">twelve types</a>. Only
                            the types: element, text, and attribute are commonly used in the web though
                            every type is available in modern web browsers. The objects representative of
                            the nodes feature properties that define their relationships or inherit methods
                            that can define their relationships, such as the parentNode property.</p>
                        <p>Because DOM Level 2, and later versions, are based upon XML syntax the DOM is
                            case-sensitive. When accessing HTML, which is not case-sensitive,
                            case-sensitivity can vary browser and browser version. It is recommended to
                            always use lower case to access HTML from the DOM to eliminate minor conformance
                            differences by browser and also force HTML elements and attribute names to lower
                            case when interpreting names returned from the DOM.</p>
                        <p>There is a standard alternative to the DOM with a lighter memory footprint
                            and arguably far faster execution time called XPath. Unfortunately, XPath is not
                            universally supported as native access method. This further reinforces the
                            importance of learning the DOM as the only universally supported and standard
                            API to access a markup document structure.</p>
                        <p>The well known
                            <em>innerHTML</em>
                            and
                            <em>outerHTML</em>
                            properties are not defined in the DOM. As such they will not be discussed here.</p>

                    <h3>History of the DOM</h3>
                    <div class="segment">
                        <p>The DOM originally came about as a standard means for accessing HTML from
                            JavaScript. Prior to the first DOM standard IE and Netscape had separate and
                            unrelated means of accessing HTML. The first standard is the original
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/">DOM Specification</a>, later
                            called DOM Level 1, from 1997. There was an immediate and vital need for
                            conformity so this document was released earlier than other
                            <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>
                            technologies.</p>
                        <p>In 1998 work began on the
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/">DOM Level 2</a>
                            specification that became a recommendation in late 2000. If you compare the
                            proposed properties of the Level 2 document to the Level 1 document you can see
                            there are wild differences. For instance DOM Level 1 identifies properties
                            directly related to tags required in HTML while DOM Level 2 is fully language
                            agnostic. The DOM Level 2 specification was written in parallel with the
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/">XML Schema Part 1: Structures</a>
                            specification. DOM Level 2 specification released revisions shortly after each
                            XML specification revision and became a formal recommendation only after XML
                            Schema became a recommendation. DOM Level 2 is primarily concerned with node
                            definitions, node types, and access to nodes via their relationships.</p>
                        <p>In 2004 the
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/">DOM Level 3 specification</a>
                            became a recommendation on the same date DOM Level 2 received its final update.
                            This was also just three weeks after a major revision to the
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PER-xmlschema-1-20040318/">XML Schema Part 1 Second Edition Edit Recommendation</a>
                            was released. Notice that DOM Level 3 extends DOM Level 2 but does not extend
                            DOM Level 1. DOM Level 3 is primarily concerned with namespaces, inheritance,
                            and extension of node names and definitions.</p>
                        <p>At this time

                            is nearing final review. DOM Level 4 is worthy of note in that it extends DOM
                            Level 2 and 3 but is focused primarily upon interaction and events instead of
                            anything related to structure or node relationships. A primary example is that
                            <em>garbage collection</em>
                            is described in the specification where in the past these discussions were left
                            entirely to the implementation of JavaScript interpreters. In a purely desktop
                            driven experience DOM Level 4 might be considered unnecessarily and excessive.
                            New platforms like mobile and tablets have proven that standard definitions for
                            events and interaction is not enough. There must also be standard guidance on
                            implementation of those events to achieve conformance, such as when the two
                            largest mobile platform developers cannot produce interfaces that execute to the
                            standards they helped write.</p>

                    <h3>How HTML Loads in Modern Browsers</h3>
                    <div class="segment">
                        <p>It is important to understand how the DOM is created. If a cached JavaScript
                            file is requested at the top of a document and is well written it is quite
                            possible that it may request access to the DOM before objects of the DOM are
                            created, which can result in unintended errors. For performance reasons it is
                            often suggested that JavaScript be requested from the bottom of a document,
                            which also provides the benefit of allowing the DOM to fully render before
                            attempts to access it are executed.</p>
                        <p>The first thing modern browsers do when encountering any markup language,
                            such as HTML, is parse the markup. Parsing does not imply producing or rendering
                            the DOM, which is a separate and later process. All modern documents use XML as
                            a parsing foundation for any XML similar markup languages, which includes not
                            well formed HTML. Because XML provides syntax rules that are terse and specific
                            writing an XML parser is much faster, easier, and cheaper than writing an HTML
                            parser. This means a smaller and faster executing parser, but more importantly
                            it means a solid foundation on which to provide additional rules necessary for
                            parsing HTML. An example of standard parsing guidance can be found in the
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Information Set</a>.</p>
                        <p>Once the markup is parsed requests for additional resources are identified
                            and those requests are executed. It is absolutely essential that the requests
                            for additional resources execute as immediately as possible as the transmission
                            time necessary to return these resources can occur simultaneously to the DOM
                            rendering. For performance it is considered a good idea to put requests for
                            visual artifacts, particularly stylesheets, as high in the document as possible
                            so that the page can render visually as the DOM renders without repainting
                            later. Another reason the DOM is created separate from the parsing process is
                            because it is significantly larger, and thus slower to produce and populate into
                            memory, than the parse data.</p>
                        <p>After the DOM is fully rendered, all requests for additional resources have
                            executed, and all initially requested JavaScript is interpreted the load of the
                            page is complete. It is only at this time that the
                            <em>onload</em>
                            executes. It is important to take note that older versions of Internet Explorer
                            require receipt of an HTTP response for all requested resources, which means
                            that if an HTTP response is never returned the onload event never executes. It
                            is also important to notice that requests for JavaScript not made from the HTML
                            have no bearing on the execution of the onload event and neither do any
                            JavaScript executions that occur outside of initial interpretation or through
                            any other API.</p>

                        <h4>Methods for Searching the DOM</h4>
                        <p>The DOM is searched using methods defined on the

                            and some methods are not. Any DOM access method executed on the document object
                            search from the
                            <em>document.documentElement</em>
                            object that represents the root node of the markup, typically the
                            <em>&lt;html&gt;</em>
                            element. The most common methods for accessing the DOM are:</p>

                                <p>This method is available to every element type node. It takes two arguments
                                    of which both are strings. The first argument is the name of the attribute and
                                    the second argument is the value to assign. If an attribute with that name
                                    already exists it will be over written otherwise a new attribute will be

                        <p>It is frequently necessary to use multiple DOM methods together to target a
                            specific node relative some starting point. This process is commonly referred to
                            as
                            <em>walking the DOM</em>. This is the only means a web browser uses to access
                            pieces of an HTML/XML document from JavaScript. All frameworks and querySelector
                            methods sugar down to the DOM methods, and all modern web browsers provide the
                            bulk of their optimizations to this API, so learning how these methods are used
                            together will allow for writing faster executing web applications. I have
                            provided some brief examples:</p>
